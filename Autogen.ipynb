      "To create a portfolio website with different pages, videos, and images, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a step-by-step plan to get you started:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Create a new folder for your project and navigate to it in the terminal or command prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Create an HTML file for each page of your portfolio. You can use a text editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text to create and edit the files. For example, you can create an \"index.html\" file for the homepage, a \"videos.html\" file for the videos page, and an \"images.html\" file for the images page.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In each HTML file, add the necessary HTML structure, including the `<head>` section and the `<body>` section. You can also link an external CSS file to style your pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Add content to each HTML file, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and videos. You can use HTML tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, and `<video>` to add these elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Create a CSS file to style your portfolio website. You can link this CSS file to each HTML file using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section. Use CSS properties like `font-family`, `color`, `background-image`, and `padding` to style your pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. If you want to add interactivity to your portfolio website, you can use JavaScript. For example, you can create a navigation menu that allows users to switch between pages without reloading the entire website. You can also add animations or other dynamic elements using JavaScript.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Test your website by opening the HTML files in a web browser. Make sure all the pages, videos, and images are displayed correctly and that the styling is applied as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Once you're satisfied with your portfolio website, you can deploy it to a web server or hosting platform to make it accessible to others. There are many options for hosting, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or a traditional web hosting provider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to save your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with the appropriate file extensions (.html, .css, .js) and ensure that all file paths are correct when linking external files.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you need any further assistance or if you have any specific requirements for your portfolio website.\n",
